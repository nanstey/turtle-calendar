# what is the first day of the indigenous turtle calendar? is it always the same day, or does it change

Short answer: In Indigenous turtle calendars, the first day and the structure of the cycles can vary by culture, but many traditions mark a 13-moon year with 13 on the turtle’s back and 28 days around, totaling 364 days. The starting point of the cycle is not universally fixed and can shift depending on local practices, ceremonies, or lunar observations.

Details by tradition

- Common structure: 13 lunar months (often depicted as 13 large scutes on the turtle’s back) and 28 days around the edge (the smaller scutes), totaling 364 days. This layout is widely referenced in Indigenous teachings and educational resources.[^1_2][^1_3][^1_8]
- Start date variability: Some communities align the first day with a specific lunar phase (e.g., new moon) or seasonal marker, while others emphasize a broader cyclical cadence rather than a fixed Gregorian-date start. As a result, the “first day” can differ between nations or communities and may reset with certain ceremonial events or lunar observations.[^1_3][^1_8]
- Intersections with the solar year: Traditional turtle calendars are lunar-based and approximate a year, but because lunar years don’t perfectly line up with the solar year, some cultures supplement or adjust their calendars with intercalary days or ceremonial timekeeping, which can affect when the cycle is considered to begin in practice.[^1_5][^1_3]

Illustration

- If you imagine the turtle’s shell as a clock face: 13 large back-scutes represent the 13 moons, and 28 small side spaces around the edge represent the days in each moon. The starting point on the back and the exact naming of the first moon differ by community, not a universal standard.[^1_8][^1_3]

Cultural variations and sources

- The Cherokee and other tribes have described a 364-day calendar via the turtle back, with an additional Green Corn day sometimes used to reconcile with the solar year, illustrating how some communities incorporate a ritual “extra day” to align cycles with seasons.[^1_3]
- Educational materials on Turtle Island communities describe the 13-moon, 28-day framework as a common mnemonic device, but emphasize local variation in the interpretation and ceremonial start points.[^1_2][^1_8]

If you’d like, I can tailor this to a specific Indigenous nation or region (e.g., Cherokee, Ojibwe, or other First Nations) and cite authoritative sources for that community’s turtle calendar start conventions.

# are there specific examples we can referece?

Yes—there are some concrete, named examples, but the exact “first day” is defined within each nation’s own system rather than by one universal rule.

### Cherokee example

- In one Cherokee teaching, Turtle’s back shows 13 moons and 28 day-marks (364 days), with an extra “Green Corn Day” as a renewal day when “everything starts anew” in midsummer. This special day is treated as a reset point in the yearly cycle, but it is linked to the Green Corn time rather than to a fixed Gregorian date like January 1.[^2_1]
- In more detailed Cherokee sacred calendar materials, days are organized into a 260‑day sacred cycle with 20 day signs and 13 numbers, where “1‑Turtle” is explicitly identified as a first day sign that sets the tone for a 13‑day period. The days “move round in a circle that really has no beginning and no end,” so while 1‑Turtle functions as a starting point in the count, the system itself is cyclical rather than tied to a single, permanently fixed start date.[^2_2]


### Ojibwe / Anishinaabe-style 13‑moon turtle calendars

- Ojibwe‑inspired educational resources describe 13 central plates on the turtle’s shell as the 13 moons, and 28 edge plates as the 28 days of each lunar period. The instruction is: when a **new moon** appears, you place a stone on the first large plate and then move a stone along the smaller plates each day. The beginning of the calendar cycle is therefore pegged to the new moon, which shifts relative to the Gregorian calendar, not to a fixed date like “always March 1.”[^2_3][^2_4]
- Other First Nations materials and nature‑center resources repeat the same pattern: 13 months, 28 days each (364 days), with the turtle shell used as a visual calendar; the **moon** (its phase and cycle) determines when a month and its count begin, so the “first day” is defined by the appearance of the new moon, not by an unchanging Western calendar date.[^2_6][^2_7][^2_9]


### General pattern you can reference

- A broadly shared teaching is: “thirteen moons, twenty‑eight days each” on the turtle’s back, totaling 364 days, often plus one extra ceremonial/rest day. This is frequently described as an Indigenous 13‑month calendar based on the turtle shell, but the first day is anchored to lunar or ceremonial markers (such as first sighting of the new moon or Green Corn time), which naturally move relative to the Gregorian calendar.[^2_5][^2_7][^2_9][^2_10]

If you tell me which community you’re most interested in (e.g., Cherokee, Ojibwe/Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee), I can narrow down to that nation’s specific “start” markers and ceremonial context for the turtle‑based calendar.

# give me all of them

Different nations and teachings use turtle‑shell calendars in related but not identical ways, and there is no single master list that covers “all” Indigenous peoples. Instead, there are several well‑documented families of examples you can reference.

## 1. Pan‑Indigenous 13‑moon turtle teaching

Many teachings summarize a shared pattern like this:

- The turtle’s back has 13 larger scutes representing 13 moons in a year, and 28 smaller plates around the edge representing 28 days per moon, totaling 364 days, plus one extra “day of rest” or ceremonial day.[^3_2][^3_6][^3_7][^3_10]
- In this framing, the **moons** and their phases (especially the new moon) govern when a new month and its first day begin, so the “first day” is not a fixed Gregorian date; it shifts with the lunar cycle.[^3_4][^3_6]

You can safely reference this as “a widely shared 13‑moon, 28‑day turtle‑shell calendar teaching across many Indigenous nations.”

## 2. Anishinaabe / Ojibwe 13‑moon turtle calendars

For Anishinaabe and Ojibwe communities, there are explicit materials that use the turtle’s back as a lunar calendar:

- The shell is described as 13 central plates and 28 surrounding plates: “the turtle’s shell was the original calendar – the larger plates representing their thirteen‑moon lunar cycle, and each moon containing 28 days.”[^3_1][^3_9]
- Instructional worksheets explain how to use it: place a marker on the first large plate when a **new moon** appears, then advance around the 28 outer plates (days); after 28 days, move the inner marker to the next large plate (next moon).[^3_9]
- Anishinaabe land‑based teachings in Pimachiowin Aki describe using the moon to know which month it is and mapping that schedule onto a turtle’s shell as a lunar calendar, while the stars give directions and the sun tells time of day.[^3_4]

In these examples, the practical “first day” is the first day of a new moon, so it changes each lunar cycle and does not stay on the same Western calendar date year to year.[^3_9][^3_4]

## 3. Haudenosaunee and Oneida 13 moons on Turtle Island

Among Haudenosaunee nations (including Oneida), turtle teachings also frame the year as 13 moons:

- Educational resources for Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee communities explicitly state that they “follow a lunar calendar with 13 moons and 28 days in each lunar month” on a turtle’s back, with each moon tied to specific seasonal practices (e.g., Midwinter Moon, Sugar/Maple Moon, Thunder Moon, Corn Moon).[^3_3][^3_6]
- Oneida language and culture materials describe the turtle shell segments as named according to seasonal practices and environmental occurrences (Green Corn, Harvest, etc.) and note that the 28 platelets around the shell represent the days in the moon cycle.[^3_5]

Again, the functional “start” is defined by midwinter or the first moon of the cycle and by local ceremonial practice, not by a single universal fixed date.[^3_3][^3_5]

## 4. Cherokee turtle calendar and “Green Corn day”

Cherokee examples give a different but related pattern:

- A Cherokee story of the turtle calendar says Turtle will have 13 spaces on its back (13 moons) and 28 spaces around its shell (days), giving 364 days.[^3_7][^3_10]
- The Cherokee year is said to have 365 days, with the extra day being **Green Corn Day**, usually in midsummer when the corn is new. On that day, all offenses are forgiven, feasts are held, and “this is the day that everything starts anew.”[^3_7]

In this teaching, the yearly “reset” is tied to Green Corn ceremonies in midsummer, not to January 1, and the precision of a daily start is less emphasized than the ceremonial renewal point.[^3_7]

Some Cherokee sacred‑calendar teaching materials also describe a 260‑day ritual cycle with 20 day signs and 13 numbers (similar in structure to Mesoamerican style counts), where a day such as “1‑Turtle” functions as the first day of a 13‑day period, but the cycle itself is continuous and circular, so it does not have a single absolute beginning.[^3_11]

## 5. Localized 13‑moon naming systems linked to turtle

Various nations have 13‑moon naming systems that may or may not be explicitly called “turtle calendars,” but are often taught today using the turtle shell image:

- An Ojibwe‑focused homeschooling article lists names of moons used by several nations (e.g., Strawberry Moon, Moon of Wild Rice, Moon of Falling Leaves, Moon When Deer Drop Their Horns), and uses a turtle art project to show 13 moons on the shell with 28 days, mirroring the turtle‑calendar pattern.[^3_1]
- Haudenosaunee‑aligned teaching materials label moons like Midwinter Moon, Great Snow Moon, Sugar/Maple Moon, Thunder Moon, Green Beans Moon, Corn Moon, each associated with specific land‑based practices through the year on a turtle‑back graphic.[^3_3]

The “first day” in these systems is defined by the start of the first moon in that nation’s ceremonial cycle (for example, midwinter ceremonies), and the naming and ordering of moons are culturally specific.[^3_1][^3_3]

***

Because these calendars are living cultural systems, there is no single exhaustive list of all Indigenous turtle‑calendar variants, and some knowledge is community‑specific or not public. The examples above (Anishinaabe/Ojibwe, Haudenosaunee/Oneida, Cherokee, and broader pan‑Indigenous 13‑moon teachings) are the main documented patterns you can safely reference in general educational contexts.[^3_6][^3_10][^3_2][^3_5][^3_4][^3_9][^3_1][^3_3][^3_7]
